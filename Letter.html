        I don’t know exactly when it happened —<br>
        maybe in the middle of your laughter,<br>
        or in the quiet way you listen,<br>
        or in the simple way your presence makes things feel lighter —<br>
        but somewhere along the way, you became special to me.<br><br>

        You have this rare gift of making ordinary moments feel meaningful.<br>
        You make conversations warmer, smiles easier, and days softer.<br>
        And even when life feels loud, somehow your energy feels calm —<br>
        like a place my mind would choose to rest.<br><br>

        This isn’t about perfection.<br>
        It’s about how effortlessly you make the world feel better<br>
        just by being in it.<br><br>

        So today, I just wanted to remind you —<br>
        you are appreciated, admired, and thought of more than you know.<br>
        And whoever gets to walk life beside you is incredibly lucky.<br><br>

        With warmth,<br>
        💌

      <h2>A Small Poem For You 🌸</h2>

      <pre class="poem">
You walk into rooms and they soften somehow,
Like sunlight learning the shape of now.
You speak, and the world leans closer to hear,
As if good things move when you’re near.

You’re not loud magic —
you’re quiet wonder,
The kind that lingers,
The kind you remember.

And if hearts had maps,
I think they’d agree —
Some places just feel
Like where love should be. 💖
